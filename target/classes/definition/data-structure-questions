Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.Data Structure is the main part of many computer science.it helps users to access and work with the data they need in
in the best way and the most important Data Structure is a systematic way to organize data in order to use it .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
-Deletion
-Searching
-Sorting
-insertion
-copy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is an Array?
-An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
-An array has both primitive data types as well as object data types. However, ArrayList has only object-type data
entries and not primitive data types.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what is LinkedList?
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How is an Array different from Linked List?
what is queue?
Java Queue represents an ordered list of elements.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is stack?
Stack is a class that falls under the Collection framework that extends the Vector class. It also implements
interfaces List, Collection, Iterable, Cloneable, Serializable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO approach is used as an operating system algorithm, which gives every process CPU time in the order they arrive.
LIFO approach is used as a queuing theory that refers to the way items are stored in types of data
structures.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is the order of complexity?
The most common complexity classes are (in ascending order of complexity): O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n),
O(nÂ²)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
-Sequential search
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
_when the search item appears at the end of the list.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is tree in data structure?
A Tree is a non-linear data structure where data objects are generally organized in terms of hierarchical relationship

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is graph in data structure?
-A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How HashMap works in java?
HashMap stores entries into multiple singly linked lists, called buckets or bins. Default number of bins is 16 and it's
 always power of 2. HashMap uses hashCode() and equals() methods on keys for get and put operations.
 So HashMap key object should provide good implementation of these methods
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?

-Using variable assignment.
-Create a new array of the same length and copy each element.
-Using the clone method of the array
-Using arraycopy() method.
-Using copyOf() method of Arrays class.
-Using copyOfRange() method of Arrays class
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
-An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked List is an ordered collection of elements of the
 same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is DFS and BFS?
-BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path. DFS(Depth First Search) uses Stack
 data structure
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Recursion?
-Recursion in java is method  that calls itself .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
In a linear data structure, the data elements connect to each other sequentially. A user can transverse each element
through a single run. In a non-linear data structure, the data elements connect to each other hierarchically.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big O describes the set of all algorithms that run no worse than a certain speed (it's an upper bound)
Conversely
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
-Insertion Sort.
-Selection Sort.
-Bubble Sort.


Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
